# CryptoSpy

CryptoSpy is a one stop shop to maintain tabs on your current wallet valuations. We use secure local authentication to ensure that your data will not be compromised. Upon login, you are able to add to your profile how many of our five watched cryptoCurrencies, and get USD valuations on those coins. Along with this, we also have a real-time updated marquee scrolling through the top of your profile page to have a constant lookup of valuation and percentage change from the opening value of the day. We also have a news page(cryptoBriefings) to ensure you are never left out of the world of cryptoCurrency, with regularly updated articles that encompass any large news.
